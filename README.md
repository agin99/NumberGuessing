~~Generate a random number between 1 and 100.~~  
~~Allow the player to guess the number.~~  
~~Tell the player if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.~~  
~~End the game when the player guesses correctly.~~  
~~Add a maximum attempt limit (e.g., 10 attempts) for the player to guess the number.~~  
~~End the game when the player runs out of attempts.~~  
~~Display a message revealing the correct number if the player fails to guess.~~  
~~Ensure the player enters only integers.~~  
~~Handle non-integer inputs gracefully (e.g., text or symbols).~~  
~~Print a message if the input is invalid and prompt the player to try again.~~  
~~Allow the player to choose a difficulty level:~~  
~~> Easy: Number range (1-10)~~  
~~> Medium: Number range (1-100)~~  
~~> Hard: Number range (1-1000)~~  
~~Adjust the number range and attempt limit based on the difficulty level selected.~~   
~~Keep track of all guesses made by the player.~~  
~~Print the list of all previous guesses at the end of the game.~~  
~~Warn the player if they try to guess a number they have already guessed before.~~  
~~Calculate a score based on how quickly the player guesses the number.~~  
~~Display the final score at the end of the game.~~  
~~Save the player's progress (current attempts, current number, and guess history) to a JSON file.~~  
~~Allow the player to resume their previous game if it exists.~~  
~~Automatically load saved progress at the start of the game.~~   

<u>Colorful Output<u>  
Add color to the output for better visuals.  
> Use red for "Game Over" or "Incorrect" messages.  
> Use green for "Correct!" messages.  

<u>Add Sound Effects<u>  
Play a "success" sound if the player guesses correctly.  
Play an "error" sound for incorrect guesses.  

<u>Multiplayer (Local Hotseat Version)<u>  
Allow for multiple accounts with username and passwords  
Require distinct usernames   
Allow two players to compete by guessing the number on alternating turns.  
Keep track of which player is guessing and switch turns.  
Display which player wins if one guesses correctly.  

<u>Multiplayer (Online Version)<u>  
Allow a player to host the game as a "server" using Python’s socket library.  
Allow another player to connect as a "client" and play remotely.  
Send guess information and feedback (too high, too low) between players in real time.  
High score leaderboard  

<u>Overlay Module<u>  
Window overlay that allows the player to toggle between account and game state  
Dynamically update as the account and game progress  

<u>Comprehensive Logging System<u>  
Log key events (e.g., player input, attempts, wins, and losses) to a file.  
Include timestamps for every log entry.  
Implement log levels (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`) using Python's logging module.  
Write logs to both a file and the console.  

<u>Exception Handling<u>  
Catch and handle errors like:  
> ValueError when non-integer input is provided.  
> FileNotFoundError when trying to load saved progress if the file doesn't exist.  
> ConnectionError if creating an online version where network issues may occur.  
Ensure the game doesn’t crash when an exception happens, and display a helpful error message.  

<u>Refactoring for Maintainability<u>  
Refactor the game logic into a GuessingGame class.  
Break the game into smaller functions, such as:  
> `startgame()`  
> `processguess()`  
> `save_progress()`  
> `load_progress()`  
> `display_guess_history()`  

<u>Packaged & Distributable Version<u>  
Turn the game into a standalone package.  
Create a setup.py or pyproject.toml file for package distribution.  
Allow installation using pip install . and run it with a simple command (e.g., guessing-game).  
Publish it to PyPI as a public or private package.
