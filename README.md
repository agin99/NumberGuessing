<u>Overlay Module<u>  
Window overlay that allows the player to toggle between account and game state  
Dynamically update as the account and game progress  

<u>Comprehensive Logging System<u>  
Log key events (e.g., player input, attempts, wins, and losses) to a file.  
Include timestamps for every log entry.  
Implement log levels (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`) using Python's logging module.  
Write logs to both a file and the console.   

<u>Refactoring for Maintainability<u>  
Refactor the game logic into a GuessingGame class.  
Break the game into smaller functions, such as:  
> `startgame()`  
> `processguess()`  
> `save_progress()`  
> `load_progress()`  
> `display_guess_history()`  

<u>Packaged & Distributable Version<u>  
Turn the game into a standalone package.  
Create a setup.py or pyproject.toml file for package distribution.  
Allow installation using pip install . and run it with a simple command (e.g., guessing-game).  
Publish it to PyPI as a public or private package.
